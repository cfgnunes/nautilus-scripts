## Advantages

While numerous *Nautilus Scripts* are available for file managers on the web, many suffer from poor functionality, lack of error checking, and dependency management. Some scripts only work with files that don't have special characters in their names, among other limitations. To address these shortcomings, I have developed my own set of scripts, which offer the following advantages:

- **Parallel task execution**: Processes multiple files simultaneously. Very fast!
- **Multi-language support**: Automatically detects the system language and displays messages in the appropriate language.
- **Progress dialog**: Displays a progress dialog and allows interruption of tasks at any time.
- **Dependency management**: Prompts users to install any missing dependencies.
- **Status notifications**: Notifies users of dependency errors and types.
- **Keyboard accelerators**: Provides keyboard shortcuts for some scripts.
- **Easy access to recent scripts**: Includes a menu, _Accessed recently_, to quickly access recently used scripts.
- **Category-based installation:** The installer allows you to choose which script categories you want to install, so there's no need to install everything.
- **Log file**: Produces an `Errors.log` file when a task finishes with an error.
- **File manager compatibility**: Designed for major file managers like GNOME Files (Nautilus), Nemo, Caja, Dolphin, and Thunar.
- **Distro compatibility**: Works on major GNU/Linux distributions, such as Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch Linux.
- **Easy adaptation**: Scripts can be easily copied and adapted for other purposes.
- **Bash implementation**: All scripts are implemented in Bash. So, the scripts work well in the shell (without a graphical interface) and file managers.
- **Shell script validation**: All scripts have been checked using [ShellCheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck).

**Design philosophy:** Fewer clicks, dependencies, and verbose notifications, with a simple and intuitive directory structure.

## Batch mode for large file selections

For very large selections (e.g., 10,000 input files), use **batch mode**: place everything inside a folder named `batch` and run the action on that folder. The scripts will process the files individually and avoid the "argument list too long" error.
